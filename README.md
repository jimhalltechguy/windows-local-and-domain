<h1>Local and Domain Accounts</h1>>
This repo outlines key elements of Windows Local and Domain Accounts.<br />
	<h2>Local Account</h2> 
 		One user on one PC, with one username and one password.</h2>
	<h2>Domain Account</h2> 
 		Allows many users to log onto a PC by using a Domain Controller (server) to store all of the many different Users and their Usernames and Passwords.</h2>
	<h2>Domain Controller Directory</h2> 
 		Acts like a phone book to record all of the different Users and their Permissions, along with their Usernames and Passwords.</h2>
